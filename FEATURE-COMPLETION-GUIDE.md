# Feature Completion Quick Guide

## When a Feature is Done - Use Automation! ðŸ¤–

Simply run this command from the main worktree:

```bash
cd ~/projects/email-matchback-workspace/main
./complete-feature.sh <worktree-name> "<PR Title>"
```

## Examples

### Phase 1 Completions

```bash
# Database Schema complete
./complete-feature.sh database-schema "Database Schema Implementation"

# UI Components complete
./complete-feature.sh ui-components "Glassmorphic UI Components"
```

### Phase 2 Completions

```bash
# Campaign Management complete
./complete-feature.sh campaign-mgmt "Campaign Management API"

# File Processing complete
./complete-feature.sh file-processing "Excel File Processing & Storage"

# Authentication complete
./complete-feature.sh authentication "NextAuth.js Authentication"

# Pattern Analysis complete
./complete-feature.sh pattern-analysis "Pattern Analysis & Correction"
```

### Phase 3 Completions

```bash
# Email Integration complete
./complete-feature.sh email-integration "Email Integration with Resend"

# Report Generation complete
./complete-feature.sh report-generation "Report Generation & Pivot Tables"

# Dashboard Pages complete
./complete-feature.sh dashboard-pages "Dashboard & Frontend Pages"

# Data Sanitization complete
./complete-feature.sh data-sanitization "Data Sanitization & DCM_ID Generation"
```

## What the Script Does Automatically

1. âœ… Commits any uncommitted changes
2. âœ… Pushes to GitHub
3. âœ… Creates Pull Request with proper formatting
4. âœ… Waits for CI checks (if configured)
5. âœ… **Merges PR automatically** with squash merge
6. âœ… Deletes feature branch on GitHub
7. âœ… Updates main worktree
8. âœ… Updates all other active worktrees
9. âœ… Prompts you to remove completed worktree

**You don't need to do anything else!** The script handles the entire workflow.

## Claude Code Workflow

When Claude Code tells you "Feature complete":

```bash
# Just run this from another terminal
cd ~/projects/email-matchback-workspace/main
./complete-feature.sh <worktree-name> "<Feature Name>"

# That's it! Everything else is automated.
```

## Transitioning Between Phases

### When All Phase 1 Features Complete

```bash
# Remove all Phase 1 worktrees (if not already removed)
cd ~/projects/email-matchback-workspace/main
git worktree remove ../database-schema  # If still exists
git worktree remove ../ui-components    # If still exists

# Create Phase 2 worktrees (4 parallel features)
git worktree add ../campaign-mgmt feature/campaign-management
git worktree add ../file-processing feature/file-processing
git worktree add ../authentication feature/authentication
git worktree add ../pattern-analysis feature/pattern-analysis

# Install dependencies
cd ../campaign-mgmt && npm install
cd ../file-processing && npm install
cd ../authentication && npm install
cd ../pattern-analysis && npm install
```

### When All Phase 2 Features Complete

```bash
# Remove all Phase 2 worktrees
cd ~/projects/email-matchback-workspace/main
git worktree remove ../campaign-mgmt
git worktree remove ../file-processing
git worktree remove ../authentication
git worktree remove ../pattern-analysis

# Create Phase 3 worktrees (4 parallel features)
git worktree add ../email-integration feature/email-integration
git worktree add ../report-generation feature/report-generation
git worktree add ../dashboard-pages feature/dashboard-pages
git worktree add ../data-sanitization feature/data-sanitization

# Install dependencies
cd ../email-integration && npm install
cd ../report-generation && npm install
cd ../dashboard-pages && npm install
cd ../data-sanitization && npm install
```

## Troubleshooting

### Script Says "Worktree not found"

```bash
# Check available worktrees
cd ~/projects/email-matchback-workspace/main
git worktree list

# Use the exact worktree name shown
./complete-feature.sh <exact-name> "Title"
```

### Merge Conflicts in Other Worktrees

```bash
# Go to the conflicting worktree
cd ~/projects/email-matchback-workspace/<worktree-name>

# Resolve conflicts manually
git status  # See conflicting files
# Edit files to resolve conflicts
git add <resolved-files>
git commit
```

### Want to Keep Worktree After Completion

```bash
# When prompted "Remove worktree?", answer: n

# You can manually remove it later:
cd ~/projects/email-matchback-workspace/main
git worktree remove ../<worktree-name>
```

## Manual Commands (If Script Fails)

If you need to do it manually:

```bash
cd ~/projects/email-matchback-workspace/<worktree-name>

# 1. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: description"
git push origin feature/branch-name

# 2. Create and merge PR
gh pr create --title "Title" --body "Description"
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch

# 3. Update main
cd ~/projects/email-matchback-workspace/main
git pull origin main

# 4. Update other worktrees
cd ~/projects/email-matchback-workspace/<other-worktree>
git merge origin/main

# 5. Remove completed worktree
cd ~/projects/email-matchback-workspace/main
git worktree remove ../<completed-worktree>
```

## Summary

**The simple workflow:**

1. Work on feature in worktree until complete
2. Run: `./complete-feature.sh <worktree-name> "Title"`
3. Answer "y" when prompted to remove worktree
4. Done! PR is merged, everything updated, worktree cleaned up.

**That's it!** The automation handles everything else. ðŸŽ‰
