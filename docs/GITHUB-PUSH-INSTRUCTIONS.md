# GitHub Push Instructions

## Current Status

Repository is fully set up locally with:
- Main branch with initial setup
- 10 feature branches created locally
- All documentation complete
- Dependencies installed
- Configuration files ready

## To Push to GitHub

### Step 1: Ensure GitHub Repository Exists

The remote is already configured:
```
https://github.com/edwinlov3tt/email-matchback.git
```

Make sure the repository exists on GitHub. If not, create it at:
https://github.com/new

Repository settings:
- Name: email-matchback
- Visibility: Private (recommended) or Public
- Do NOT initialize with README (we already have one)

### Step 2: Push Main Branch

```bash
# Push main branch
git push -u origin main
```

If you get a permission error, you may need to authenticate with GitHub CLI:
```bash
gh auth login
```

Or use a personal access token:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/edwinlov3tt/email-matchback.git
```

### Step 3: Push All Feature Branches

After main is pushed successfully:

```bash
# Push all feature branches
git push -u origin feature/database-schema
git push -u origin feature/campaign-management
git push -u origin feature/file-processing
git push -u origin feature/pattern-analysis
git push -u origin feature/email-integration
git push -u origin feature/report-generation
git push -u origin feature/glassmorphic-ui
git push -u origin feature/authentication
git push -u origin feature/dashboard-pages
git push -u origin feature/data-sanitization
```

Or push all at once:
```bash
git push --all origin
```

### Step 4: Set Up Branch Protection

On GitHub:
1. Go to Settings > Branches
2. Add branch protection rule for `main`:
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Require branches to be up to date
   - Require conversation resolution
   - Include administrators

### Step 5: Verify Setup

Check that all branches are visible on GitHub:
```bash
git branch -r
```

Should show:
```
origin/feature/authentication
origin/feature/campaign-management
origin/feature/dashboard-pages
origin/feature/data-sanitization
origin/feature/database-schema
origin/feature/email-integration
origin/feature/file-processing
origin/feature/glassmorphic-ui
origin/feature/pattern-analysis
origin/feature/report-generation
origin/main
```

## Feature Branch Assignments

Now you can start multiple Claude Code instances:

### Instance 1: Database Foundation
```bash
git checkout feature/database-schema
# Start working on database entities and migrations
```

### Instance 2: UI Foundation
```bash
git checkout feature/glassmorphic-ui
# Start working on glassmorphic components
```

### Instance 3: Authentication (after database-schema merged)
```bash
git checkout feature/authentication
# Start working on NextAuth.js setup
```

## Parallel Development Workflow

### For Each Feature Branch:

1. **Checkout the branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/branch-name
   ```

2. **Make changes**
   - Follow FEATURE-BRANCHES.md for scope
   - Meet acceptance criteria
   - Write tests

3. **Commit frequently**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(scope): description"
   ```

4. **Push to remote**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/branch-name
   ```

5. **Create pull request**
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "feat: Feature name" --body "Description"
   ```

6. **After PR approval and merge**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

## Dependency Management

Some features depend on others:

**Can start immediately**:
- feature/database-schema
- feature/glassmorphic-ui

**After database-schema**:
- feature/campaign-management
- feature/file-processing
- feature/authentication
- feature/pattern-analysis

**After file-processing**:
- feature/data-sanitization

**After campaign-management + file-processing**:
- feature/email-integration

**After pattern-analysis**:
- feature/report-generation

**After glassmorphic-ui + campaign-management**:
- feature/dashboard-pages
