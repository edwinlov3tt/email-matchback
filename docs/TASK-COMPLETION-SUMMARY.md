10. **dashboard-pages.md** - Frontend pages with glassmorphic UI
11. **data-sanitization.md** - DCM_ID generation and PII removal

### Updated Documentation

**docs/FEATURE-BRANCHES.md** - Added:
- Parallel Development Matrix (3 phases)
- File Path Isolation Matrix (shows zero conflicts)
- Dependency Tree (visual hierarchy)
- Phase-by-phase execution plan

## Parallel Development Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
**2 instances can run simultaneously:**
- Instance 1: `database-schema` (backend entities)
- Instance 2: `glassmorphic-ui` (frontend components)

**Why no conflicts**: Different directories (backend vs frontend)

### Phase 2: Core Services (Week 3-4)
**4 instances can run simultaneously:**
- Instance 1: `campaign-management` (apps/api/src/campaigns/)
- Instance 2: `file-processing` (apps/api/src/storage/)
- Instance 3: `authentication` (apps/web/app/api/auth/, apps/api/src/auth/)
- Instance 4: `pattern-analysis` (apps/api/src/patterns/)

**Why no conflicts**: Separate NestJS modules in different directories

### Phase 3: Integration (Week 5-6)
**4 instances can run simultaneously:**
- Instance 1: `email-integration` (apps/api/src/email/)
- Instance 2: `report-generation` (apps/api/src/reports/)
- Instance 3: `dashboard-pages` (apps/web/app/, apps/web/components/dashboard/)
- Instance 4: `data-sanitization` (apps/api/src/matching/)

**Why no conflicts**: Different modules and concerns

## Key Features of Task Instructions

### Type Safety Enforcement
Every task specifies exact types to use from `@matchback/types`:
```typescript
// Example from database-schema.md
import { Campaign, CampaignStatus, CampaignType, Priority } from '@matchback/types';
```

### Step-by-Step Implementation
Each task includes:
- Complete file-by-file implementation
- Code examples with exact syntax
- Validation checklists
- Testing requirements

### Completion Summary Requirements
Every task requires a completion summary with:
1. Files created with line counts
2. Type definitions used from @matchback/types
3. Features that can now be started
4. Known issues or todos

### Example Summary Format
```markdown
# Database Schema - COMPLETE

## Files Created (9 files, 500 lines)
- Campaign entity with 15 fields
- MatchRecord entity with 19 fields
- User entity with 8 fields

## Type Safety ✓
All entities match @matchback/types interfaces exactly

## Features Unlocked
✓ campaign-management
✓ file-processing
✓ authentication
✓ pattern-analysis
```

## File Path Isolation

Complete separation ensures zero merge conflicts:

```
Backend (apps/api/src/):
├── campaigns/entities/     ← database-schema
├── campaigns/campaigns.*   ← campaign-management
├── storage/                ← file-processing
├── patterns/               ← pattern-analysis
├── email/                  ← email-integration
├── reports/                ← report-generation
├── matching/               ← data-sanitization
└── auth/                   ← authentication

Frontend (apps/web/):
├── components/ui/          ← glassmorphic-ui
├── components/dashboard/   ← dashboard-pages
├── components/campaigns/   ← dashboard-pages
├── app/campaigns/          ← dashboard-pages
├── app/upload/             ← dashboard-pages
└── app/api/auth/           ← authentication
```

**Result**: Zero file overlap = Zero merge conflicts

## Critical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Task
- Complete TypeORM entities for Campaign, MatchRecord, User
- Migrations with proper indexes
- Seed data for testing
- **Type alignment**: Entities MUST match @matchback/types interfaces exactly

### Glassmorphic UI Task
- 6 reusable components (GlassCard, GlassButton, GlassInput, GlassModal, GradientBackground, StatusBadge)
- Framer Motion animations
- lucide-react icons (no emojis)
- Demo page at `/components-demo`

### Pattern Analysis Task
- **CRITICAL**: Pattern correction logic for new signups
- Logic: `if (signupMonth === visitMonth && totalVisits >= 3 && inPattern === true)`
- Must override to `inPattern = false` with reason `NEW_SIGNUP_CORRECTION`

## Validation Approach

Every task includes validation checklist:
- [ ] All files compile without TypeScript errors
- [ ] All imports resolve correctly
- [ ] Types match @matchback/types exactly
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] ESLint passes
- [ ] No console.log statements
- [ ] Summary provided to user

## Timeline

- **Weeks 1-2**: Phase 1 (2 parallel instances)
- **Weeks 3-4**: Phase 2 (4 parallel instances)
- **Weeks 5-6**: Phase 3 (4 parallel instances)
- **Weeks 7-8**: Integration testing and deployment

**Total**: 6-8 weeks with maximum parallelization

## How to Use

1. **Check out feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/database-schema
   ```

2. **Read task file**:
   ```bash
   cat tasks/database-schema.md
   ```

3. **Follow instructions exactly**:
   - Use specified types
   - Create specified files
   - Implement validation
   - Write tests

4. **Provide completion summary**:
   - List files created
   - Confirm types used
   - State features unlocked

## Next Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**:

   git push origin main
   git push --all origin
   ```

2. **Start Phase 1**:
   - Claude Code Instance 1: `git checkout feature/database-schema`
   - Claude Code Instance 2: `git checkout feature/glassmorphic-ui`

3. **After Phase 1 merges to main**:
   - Start all 4 Phase 2 features in parallel

4. **After Phase 2 merges to main**:
   - Start all 4 Phase 3 features in parallel
